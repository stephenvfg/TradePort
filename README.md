# Description

TradePort is a hyper-local peer-to-peer trading app for travelers. For anyone in a major travel hub, they can use TradePort to avoid currency exchange fees by trading directly with another human. You can also find travel-specific items such as city tour guidebooks and metro cards that still have remaining value.
